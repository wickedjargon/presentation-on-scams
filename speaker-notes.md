## Summary: Overall Dollar Loss Breakdown (2020–2024)

- Source: Data sourced from CAFC (Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre).
- Reporting Reality: It is estimated that the reporting rate is only 5%–10%.
- The Big Picture: Actual annual losses likely exceed $6 Billion when accounting for unreported cases.

Graph Description / Speaker Notes:
> The following graph presents a dollar loss breakdown based on the total dollar loss for processed reports between 2020 and 2024. The CAFC has seen a steady increase in the total amount lost by victims since 2020, though the increase has slowed since 2022. Although there has been a decrease in the number of reports processed at the CAFC, the CAFC has been able to show an increase in total dollar loss by prioritizing its work around high-value and high-impact frauds.

- The Outcome: Of course, the keys are never shipped.

# Slide 11
## Money Mules: Complicit vs. Unknowing

**Unknowing Money Mule (Romance Variation):**
- The Setup: In a romance scam, the victim is told the "partner" doesn't have access to their own bank account.
- The Task: They are told that others will send money to the victim, and the victim must convert that money into cryptocurrency or gift cards to send to the partner.
- The Reality: The victim has become a money launderer without knowing it.

**Complicit Money Mule:**
- The Setup: The person knowingly agrees to move money for others, often recruited through job ads or social media promising "easy money."
- The Crime: They receive funds (often from fraud victims) into their account and transfer them elsewhere, keeping a percentage.
- The Risk: Both types face criminal charges—ignorance is not always a legal defense.

# Slide 12
## Specific Example: Job Scams (The Fastest Growing)

- The Solicitation: Victims are contacted via unsolicited SMS (text messages) or social media apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. They often use the names of real, reputable Canadian companies to gain trust.
- The Task Hook: The offer is usually for a remote data entry or product optimizer role. Victims are asked to complete simple tasks—like rating videos or boosting products—to earn commissions.
- The Trap: To level up to higher-paying tasks or to reset a negative balance in their account, the victim is told they must deposit their own funds, usually via cryptocurrency.
- The Outcome: The platform shows fake earnings that look real, but withdrawals are blocked by fees or taxes.
- Trend Note: Per the 2024 CAFC report, job scams saw the largest increase in dollar loss ($17M increase) due to the rise of these task-based schemes.
